/*the other stuff seems far and few in the c book.
 * things to keep in mind is std in files all work about the same. 
 * printf scanf just work on stdin stdout witch can be redirected to files or other strings or what ever.
 * stder will almost always print to the screen. like if stdout points to a file or another program, then any debug prints will be fed into file or program and make things harder to debug
 * error codes are useful for checking if a subprocsses ran correctly. as the value returned go back to the parent procssee.
 *
 * 7.3 variable length augument lists. this is a really intresting topic
 * able to have unnamed argument.
 * i guess i am basicly done with learning c. just need to understand libs and write some more programs.
